### My Research Focus
I am interested in identifying, learning, and understanding the systemic barriers and stereotypes that are systematically preventing groups of people with diverse genders, races, cultures, and background from participating in computer science (CS).

### Current Research Projects
I’m investigating the kinds recruiting and marketing practices 14 informal computer science learning programs across the Puget Sound are using and how the practices are influencing the gender, racial, and SES diversity of who participates. I conducted 14 semi-structured interviews and asked questions to elucidate the kinds of marketing and recruiting practices used, the diversity of staff and students at the programs, and the problems that each program faced when it comes to broadening diversity in CS.


I'm also investigating how to use InclusiveMag, a meta-method used to create inclusive methods along the line of one diversity dimension, to help create a new method called Socioeconomic Status Magnifier (SESMag). Socioeconomic status (SES) goes beyond a person's income level; it considers a person’s educational, occupational, and social opportunities and privileges. SES can have profound effects on a person’s interactions with technology, and technology’s impact on a person. We identified five facets that are critical to how low SES people interact with technology and that can be used ubiquitously across SES populations.


Over the summer, I helped evaluate how well an inclusive design activity (IDAs) enabled computing students to recognize and respond to the exclusionary assumptions built into human-computer interaction artifacts worked. The activity involved students identifying the assumptions that five different IDAs had. In total, we discovered nine assumptions that students identifed when evaluating the IDAs.


### Senior Capstone
At Oregon State University all undergraduate engineering students who are in their last year are required to do a capstone project. The course lasts the whole year. I am apart of the research track for capstone so I have been working on research that I conducted over the summer of 2020. [Milestone One](https://christopherperdriau.github.io/Milestone_1.pdf) was the first assignment of the class where I was tasked with identifying projects that I might like to work on. [Milestone Two](https://christopherperdriau.github.io/Milestone_2.pdf) required me to identify the significance of my research and outline some possible research questions. The other component of this assignment was to create an annotated bibliography. Then, at the end of the second quarter I was required to give a [presentation](https://christopherperdriau.github.io/talk.pdf) on my resarch. Durning my presentation I discussed how my research was related to computer science, the motivations for the resaerch, what prior research has shown, and some preliminary results. I have not published this research yet, but am planning to within the next two months. People can expect to see this work in the ACM Transactions on Computing Education Journal.
