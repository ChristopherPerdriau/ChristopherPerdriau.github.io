I’m investigating the kinds recruiting and marketing practices 14 informal computer science learning programs across the Puget Sound are using and how the practices are influencing the gender, racial, and SES diversity of who participates. I conducted 14 semi-structured interviews and asked questions to elucidate the kinds of marketing and recruiting practices used, the diversity of staff and students at the programs, and the problems that each program faced when it comes to broadening diversity in CS.


I'm also investigating how to use InclusiveMag, a meta-method used to create inclusive methods along the line of one diversity dimension, to help create a new method called Socioeconomic Status Magnifier (SESMag). Socioeconomic status (SES) goes beyond a person's income level; it considers a person’s educational, occupational, and social opportunities and privileges. SES can have profound effects on a person’s interactions with technology, and technology’s impact on a person. We identified five facets that are critical to how low SES people interact with technology and that can be used ubiquitously across SES populations.


Over the summer, I helped evaluate how well an inclusive design activity (IDAs) enabled computing students to recognize and respond to the exclusionary assumptions built into human-computer interaction artifacts worked. The activity involved students identifying the assumptions that five different IDAs had. In total, we discovered nine assumptions that students identifed when evaluating the IDAs.
